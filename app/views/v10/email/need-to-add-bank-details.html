    <p>You’ve applied for the hire a new apprentice payment.</p>
    <p>Before we can make the payment, you need to <a class="govuk-link" href="../account-bank-needed">sign into your apprenticeship service account</a> and add your organisation's bank details.</p>
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What happens next</h3>
    <p>After you add the bank details, we’ll review them and may contact a person with significant control to verify the information you’ve provided.</p>
    <p>You’ll receive the first payment after the apprentice completes 90 days of their apprenticeship and the second payment after 365 days.</p>
    <p>We make payments on the 10th working day of each month.</p>
