      <p class="govuk-body">We cannot make the hire a new apprentice payment until we have your organisation’s bank details.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">When you’ve added the bank details</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">You’re eligible for the first payment after the apprentice completes 90 days of their apprenticeship training and the second payment after 365 days.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Before we can make a payment, we need your training provider to confirm whether the apprentice is still on their apprenticeship. Training providers usually submit information about their apprentices at the start of every month.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">We'll start making payments from January 2021. It will take longer to get your first payment for any apprentices who start their training in August 2020.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!">Changes to your payment</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">Your payment amount may change if an apprentice has their 25th birthday before they start their apprenticeship.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">We cannot make your payment if:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>an apprentice is on a break in learning</li>
        <li>an apprentice’s contract of employment ends before they complete 90 or 365 days of their apprenticeship</li>
        <li>the training provider does not confirm that the apprentice has started their apprenticeship</li>
        <li>the apprentice started their contract of employment before 1 August 2020</li>
