        <p>Dear <span class="placeholder-no-brackets">EMPLOYER LTD</span>,</p>
        <p>You’ve not added EMPLOYER LTD’s organisation and finance details, so we cannot make the hire a new apprentice payment.</p>
        <p>Either you or someone else at EMPLOYER LTD can add the organisation and finance details at 
           https://accounts.manage-apprenticeships.service.gov.uk/service/index. You'll need to sign in with your apprenticeship service account.</p>

        <p>We cannot send any payments until we’ve verified EMPLOYER LTD’s organisation and finance details. This could take up to 90 days and we may contact someone from EMPLOYER LTD.</p>

        <p>Payments are sent by Bacs on the 14th working day of the month. It usually takes 3 working days to process the payment.</p>
