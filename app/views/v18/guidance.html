      <p class="govuk-body">The hire a new apprentice payment is available for employers that take on new apprentices from 1 August 2020 to 31 March 2021. Employers can apply for the payment after they add new apprentices to their apprenticeship service account.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">The payment is in addition to the existing £1,000 an employer will already get for taking on an apprentice who is either:</p>

      <li>aged 16 to 18 years old</li>
