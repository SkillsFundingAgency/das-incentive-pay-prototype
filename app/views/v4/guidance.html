      <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Apply for the 16 to 24 apprentice grant</h1>
      <p>The 16 to 24 apprentice grant is available for employers that take on new apprentices from September 2020. Employers can apply for the grant after they add each apprentice to their apprenticeship service account.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What you'll get</h2>
      <p>For apprentices aged 16 to 24, employers will receive £3,000. We’ll pay the grant in 2 equal instalments, 90 and 365 days after you apply.</p>
      <p>You’ll need to give us your organisation’s bank details when you apply, so that we can pay you the grant directly. We’ll pay the grant for all eligible apprentices from each application at the same time.</p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What you can use the grant for</h2>
      <p>You can use the grant for anything to support your organisation’s costs during coronavirus.</p>
      <p>The grant is different to the apprenticeship levy and you do not have to follow the apprenticeship funding rules when you use it.</p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Eligibility</h2>
      <p>Employers can only apply for this grant for apprentices that are new to their payroll.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Apprentices who were made redundant</h2>
      <p>Employers can take on and apply for the grant for apprentices who were made redundant by their previous employer. This includes apprentices who are going to either:</p>
