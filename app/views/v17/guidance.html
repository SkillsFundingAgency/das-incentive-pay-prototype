        <p>The hire a new apprentice payment is available for employers that take on new apprentices from 1 August 2020 to 31 March 2021. Employers can apply for the payment after they add new apprentices to their apprenticeship service account.</p>
        <p>The payment is in addition to the existing £1,000 you’ll already get for taking on an apprentice who is either:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>aged 16 to 18 years old</li>
        <li>under 25 and has an education, health and care plan or has been in the care of their local authority</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What you’ll get</h2>
        <p>For apprentices aged:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>16 to 24, employers will receive £2,000</li>
        <li>25 and over, employers will receive £1,500</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We’ll make the payment in 2 equal instalments for each apprentice. The first payment is after an apprentice completes 90 days of their apprenticeship and the second is after 365 days.</p>
        <p>Payments are made by Bacs on the 14th working day of the month. It usually takes 3 working days to process.</p>
        <p>We’ll need your organisation’s bank details, so that we can pay your organisation directly.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What you can use the payment for</h2>
        <p>You can use the payment for anything to support your organisation’s costs.</p>
        <p>The payment is different to the apprenticeship levy and you can use it to pay for recruiting and employing new apprentices.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Eligibility</h2>
        <p>You cannot apply for an existing employee who joined your organisation before 1 August 2020, even if they started an apprenticeship after this date.</p>
