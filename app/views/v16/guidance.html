      <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Apply for the hire a new apprentice payment</h1>
      <p>The hire a new apprentice payment is available for employers that take on new apprentices from 1 August 2020 to 31 January 2021. Employers can apply for the payment after they add new apprentices to their apprenticeship service account.</p>
      <p>The payment is in addition to the existing £1,000 you’ll already get for taking on an apprentice who is either:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>aged 16 to 18 years old</li>
      <li>under 25 and has an education, health and care plan or has been in the care of their local authority</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What you'll get</h2>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

      <li>25 and over, employers will receive £1,500</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You’ll get the payment in 2 equal instalments, after the apprentice completes 90 and 365 days of their apprenticeship.</p>
      <p>We make payments on the 10th working day of each month. You’ll need to give us your organisation’s bank details when you apply, so that we can pay you directly.</p>
